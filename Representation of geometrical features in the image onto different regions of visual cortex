Title: Representation of geometrical features in the image onto different regions of visual cortex

Brief scientific background: Image recognition by the human visual system involves detection and discrimination of various features projectected by the image. Different features of the image are encoded by different regions in the visual cortex although how these features ultimately lead to form the complete image is an elusive question.

Proposed analyses: Classifying different  geometrical features of the  images given in the Kay-Gallant dataset  by encoding the fMRI activity using Support Vector Machines (SVM). Further we will  decode the image features implementing  Convolution Neural Network (CNN).

Predictions/Result: Careful analysis of the fMRI activity of the brain can help us to build computational models of the human visual cortex in which invasive methods of brain probing canâ€™t be feasible. 
We hypothesize that following the roadmap which we briefly discussed here, will help us to dig more deeply into image feature segregation in the visual cortex and further will be helpful in investigating role of different visual cortical areas in feature detection and discrimination. 

Dataset: Kay Gallant fMRI data.
